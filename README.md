# shortest_route_optimizer

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.

## Note
The APIs used in this project throw cross-origin exceptions. To overcome this problem, I used a forward proxy to pass the API calls to the respective origins.

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.
